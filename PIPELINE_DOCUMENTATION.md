# **Architecting a Robust Data Processing Solution**

## **Objective**
The goal of this project is to create a robust data processing pipeline that integrates operational and analytical databases, performs efficient data replication, applies transformations, and monitors the process. This solution demonstrates architectural design thinking, tool selection, and proficiency in implementing a structured data infrastructure.

## **1. Why This Design?**
This design was chosen to ensure scalability, maintainability, and efficient handling of data from operational to analytical workflows. The combination of PostgreSQL, Snowflake, and Apache Airflow provides an optimal balance between performance, cost, and extensibility. Key considerations include:  
- **Ease of Integration**: Seamless connectivity between PostgreSQL and Snowflake via replication.  
- **Scalability**: Snowflake’s ability to handle large-scale analytics with minimal configuration.  
- **Automation**: Apache Airflow orchestrates and automates the data pipeline with DAGs for ETL processes.

## **2. How Does the Pipeline Work?**
1. **Operational Database Setup**:  
   - PostgreSQL serves as the OLTP database to store real-time weather data fetched from the Weather API.  
   - Python scripts populate the database periodically, ensuring fresh and consistent data.  

2. **Data Replication**:  
   - Batch processing replicates data from PostgreSQL to Snowflake, with a controlled delay for efficiency.  
   - Data replication is monitored and logged using Airflow DAGs.  

3. **Data Transformation**:  
   - Raw data is transformed into analytical models in Snowflake:  
     - **Fact Table**: `weather_fact`  
     - **Dimension Tables**: `city_dim`, `time_dim`, `weather_condition_dim`  
   - Handling null values and deduplication ensures data integrity and consistency.  

4. **Monitoring**:  
   - Airflow’s built-in monitoring tracks the success and failure of DAG runs.  
   - Logs are reviewed to ensure seamless operation and quick resolution of issues.

## **3. Key Features**
- **Scalable Architecture**:  
  - Designed to handle increasing data volumes by leveraging Snowflake’s compute resources.  

- **Automated Workflows**:  
  - Apache Airflow automates data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks.  

- **Resilient Design**:  
  - Solutions for common data issues, such as deduplication and null value handling, ensure reliable operations.  

- **Replicable Environment**:  
  - Docker containers provide a consistent environment for setup and deployment.

## **4. Why is This Pipeline Better?**
- **Tool Efficiency**:  
  - PostgreSQL offers a robust OLTP system, while Snowflake excels in OLAP workloads.  
  - Airflow orchestrates tasks with visibility and ease of scheduling.  

- **Cost-Effectiveness**:  
  - Leveraging Snowflake’s pay-as-you-go model ensures costs align with usage.  

- **Flexibility**:  
  - The modular approach allows easy addition of new data sources and transformations.  

- **Addressing Challenges**:  
  - Specific challenges like deduplication and key management were addressed effectively, demonstrating adaptability.

## **Conclusion**
This data pipeline integrates the best tools for each layer of the process, from data ingestion to analytical reporting. Its modular design, scalability, and automation make it a future-proof solution for real-time and batch processing needs. By combining PostgreSQL, Snowflake, and Airflow, this architecture is well-suited for both small-scale and enterprise-level applications.
