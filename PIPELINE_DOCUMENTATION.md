# Robust Data Processing Solution

## Objective

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a robust data processing pipeline that integrates operational and analytical databases, replicates data efficiently, applies transformations, and monitors the entire process. The solution leverages PostgreSQL, Snowflake, and Apache Airflow, ensuring scalability, security, cost-effectiveness, and extensibility. 

The pipeline minimizes the use of cloud services like AWS, GCP, and Azure, offering a robust solution that can be deployed on-premises.

## Why This Design?

This design ensures the following:

- **Ease of Integration**: Seamless connection between PostgreSQL (OLTP) and Snowflake (OLAP) using the Snowflake Connector for PostgreSQL.
- **Scalability**: Snowflake handles large-scale analytics with minimal configuration.
- **Automation**: Apache Airflow automates the ETL processes via Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
- **Minimal Cloud Dependency**: The Snowflake-to-PostgreSQL connector minimizes reliance on external cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Azure, providing flexibility in on-premises deployments.

## How Does the Pipeline Work?

### 1. **Operational Database Setup**

- **PostgreSQL** is used as the OLTP database, storing real-time weather data fetched from a Weather API.
- Python scripts periodically update the database to ensure fresh and consistent data.

### 2. **Connecting PostgreSQL to Snowflake**

- The **Snowflake Connector for PostgreSQL** facilitates the secure and efficient replication of data from PostgreSQL to Snowflake.
- **RSA key-based authentication** ensures secure communication, while Snowflake’s scheduling features enable controlled data updates.

### 3. **Data Replication**

- Batch processing replicates data from PostgreSQL to Snowflake using the Snowflake Connector.
- Data replication processes are monitored for success or failure using **Airflow DAGs** and Snowflake's monitoring tools.

### 4. **Data Transformation**

- Raw data in Snowflake is transformed into analytical models:
  - **Fact Table**: `weather_fact`
  - **Dimension Tables**: `city_dim`, `time_dim`, `weather_condition_dim`
- SQL logic resolves challenges like **deduplication** and **null value handling** to ensure data integrity.

### 5. **Monitoring and Query Tracking**

- Query execution and replication statuses are tracked using **Snowflake’s History tab** and system views like `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE`.
- **Airflow's monitoring tools** provide visibility into ETL workflows and failures.

## Why is This Pipeline Better?

- **Secure and Efficient Data Movement**: Ensures secure replication with RSA key-based authentication and reliable scheduling mechanisms.
- **Optimized Workload Distribution**: PostgreSQL is ideal for OLTP tasks, while Snowflake efficiently handles OLAP workloads.
- **Cost-Effective**: Snowflake's pay-as-you-go pricing ensures scalability without unnecessary costs.
- **Modular and Flexible**: The architecture allows easy integration of new data sources and transformations.
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Airflow and Snowflake provide comprehensive monitoring to ensure pipeline health and performance.
- **Reduced Cloud Services Dependency**: Minimizes reliance on cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) while providing an effective on-premises solution.

## How This Pipeline Benefits the Company

The company already utilizes its own on-premises warehouse and Kubernetes clusters for infrastructure management. Here's how this data pipeline aligns with and benefits the company’s current setup:

- **Optimized for On-Premises Infrastructure**: This pipeline can be deployed entirely within the company’s on-premises warehouse, minimizing cloud dependencies. It integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes for containerized deployments, ensuring flexibility and ease of scalability.
- **Efficient Resource Management**: By leveraging PostgreSQL and Snowflake with Kubernetes clusters, the pipeline can efficiently manage workloads and scale up or down based on demand, all within the company's infrastructure.
- **Cost Savings**: By utilizing existing on-premises infrastructure and minimizing reliance on cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure, the company can reduce operational costs while still achieving scalability and high performance.
- **Customizability**: The Snowflake-to-PostgreSQL connector allows the company to have more control over the integration, providing a higher level of customizability for data replication, transformation, and monitoring.
- **Data Security**: Since the infrastructure is hosted on-premises, the company can ensure full control over data security, compliance, and privacy policies, reducing exposure to external threats.
- **Seamless Integration with Kubernetes**: The pipeline’s architecture fits naturally within a Kubernetes-managed environment, allowing for easy container orchestration and seamless deployment and scaling across multiple nodes.
